        <p class="">
          Our company, founded by Candelario Lopez Robles, has a long and rich history dating back to the 1980s, when Candelario, a Mexican immigrant, arrived in California. He began his career in the gardening field, but through hard work and determination, he eventually started his own landscaping and design firm.
          Over the years, our company has grown and flourished, earning a reputation as an award-winning design and construction firm. Candelario has worked with notable figures such as the mayor of Lancaster, Rex Parris, and has collaborated with Daniel Jacobs, the CEO of the Antelope Valley fairgrounds, to rejuvenate the space and transform it into a world-class events center. In addition, Candelario co-founded Amigos De La Feria, an institution that aims to bring a Hispanic business presence to the Antelope Valley. Candelario is known for his dedication and expertise, and has built a strong reputation in the community.
          We are proud of our roots and the hard work and dedication that has brought us to where we are today. As we look to the future, we remain committed to providing the highest quality services to our clients and to upholding the values of hard work and excellence that have defined our company from the very beginning.
